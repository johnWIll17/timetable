1.
  when move subject from list to timetable
  the subject is removed from the CURRENT list

  BUT
  if we click to icons in filters-bar

  => we got all subjects come back (including the one that we have already moved to timetable)
     because each time we click on icons in filters-bar
     we call AJAX to full subjects /or/ subjects of a category ...


=> SOLUTION

   write a function in each callback AJAX function above
   check to see if we have text in timetable
   just pull subjects that is NOT in timetable (check by subject_name)
